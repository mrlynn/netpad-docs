NetPad cartoon strip visual style guide

Overall tone
	•	Light, sarcastic, slightly slapstick
	•	Developer pain is exaggerated
	•	NetPad hero is calm, confident, almost bored
	•	Humor comes from contrast, not dialogue overload

No cruelty, no cynicism toward developers. NetPad laughs with them.

⸻

Art style

Line work
	•	Clean, bold outlines
	•	Consistent stroke weight
	•	Rounded corners, no sharp edges
	•	Minimal interior detail

Think simple shapes first, detail second.

⸻

Color
	•	Limited palette
	•	Primary colors:
	•	NetPad green as the hero accent
	•	Dark gray or near-black for developer world
	•	Light neutral backgrounds

Developer pain scenes lean dull and gray.
NetPad scenes introduce color and clarity.

⸻

Shading
	•	Flat color with very subtle gradients
	•	No heavy shadows
	•	No realism

Everything should read clearly at small sizes.

⸻

Backgrounds
	•	Sparse
	•	Suggestive rather than detailed
	•	Desks, screens, forms represented symbolically

Avoid clutter that competes with the joke.

⸻

Character design

The developer
	•	Same character every time
	•	Neutral gender presentation
	•	Casual hoodie or t-shirt
	•	Messy desk
	•	Expressive face

The developer is earnest, tired, and relatable.

⸻

NetPad robot hero
	•	Always composed
	•	Friendly smile or neutral calm
	•	Minimal motion compared to chaos around it
	•	Often enters from the side or background

The hero never panics. Ever.

⸻

Facial expressions
	•	Developer: exaggerated frustration, shock, despair, relief
	•	NetPad hero: calm smile, slight smirk, knowing nod

Contrast is key.

⸻

Panel layout

Panel count
	•	3 or 4 panels only
	•	Consistent grid
	•	Equal panel sizes

Predictability helps the punchline land.

⸻

Text usage
	•	Short captions only
	•	No speech bubbles unless essential
	•	Let visuals do the work

If text explains the joke, the joke needs work.

⸻

Reusable visual metaphors

Use these often so readers learn the language.
	•	Bugs as small gremlins
	•	Validation errors as red warning tape
	•	Spaghetti for logic
	•	Monsters for complexity
	•	Buttons as oversized, physical objects

⸻

Running gags and recurring jokes

These should appear subtly across many strips. Not all at once.

1. The developer’s coffee mug
	•	Always on the desk
	•	Text changes slightly over time
	•	Examples:
	•	“It worked yesterday”
	•	“TODO”
	•	“One more fix”
	•	“Why though”

Occasionally empty. Occasionally overflowing.

⸻

2. The same bug keeps returning
	•	Small bug character
	•	Wears a tiny hat or label
	•	Shows up in different forms
	•	Always looks smug

Eventually looks tired when NetPad shows up.

⸻

3. The broken clock
	•	On the wall behind the developer
	•	Always stuck at 3:17
	•	Never addressed
	•	Silent commentary on late nights

⸻

4. The sticky note wall
	•	Background element
	•	Notes pile up over time
	•	Notes say things like:
	•	“Quick fix”
	•	“Refactor later”
	•	“Ask future me”
	•	“Why?”

NetPad scenes remove or neatly align them.

⸻

5. NetPad hero’s entrance
	•	Never dramatic
	•	No explosions
	•	Often already present in the panel unnoticed
	•	Sometimes holding coffee or clipboard

The hero solves problems quietly.

⸻

6. Oversized buttons
	•	Publish
	•	Approve
	•	Run
	•	Import

Buttons are physical objects NetPad presses with ease.
Developers struggle to reach them.

⸻

7. The progress bar gag
	•	Appears in multiple strips
	•	Sometimes barely moving
	•	Sometimes absurdly long
	•	Once wrapped around the room

NetPad resolves it instantly.

⸻

8. The developer’s chair
	•	Slowly deteriorates across strips
	•	Missing wheel
	•	Tape on armrest
	•	Finally replaced after NetPad solves things

A long arc joke.

⸻

NetPad hero behavior rules

These are important.
	•	Never explains in detail
	•	Never lectures
	•	Never mocks the developer
	•	Never breaks composure

NetPad demonstrates, not debates.

⸻

Visual consistency checklist for illustrators

Before finalizing any strip, check:
	•	Same developer character?
	•	Same NetPad hero proportions?
	•	Clear contrast between chaos and calm?
	•	One clear visual punchline?
	•	No unnecessary detail?

If something distracts from the joke, remove it.
