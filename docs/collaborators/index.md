# Collaborators Overview

## Build MongoDB Apps in Minutes, Not Months

Welcome to the NetPad collaborators hub. This section contains everything you need to get up to speed and start contributing.

---

## What We're Building

NetPad is a **MongoDB-native development platform** that lets teams build internal tools, data collection apps, and automated workflows without the typical 3-month dev cycle.

Think of it as **MongoDB Atlas + form builder + workflow automation** in one open-source package.

The core insight: most internal tools follow the same pattern—collect data, store it, route it, act on it. NetPad makes that loop fast.

## What Makes It Different

### "Build Once, Deploy Twice"

Create a form schema once, deploy it as both a traditional field-based UI *and* an AI-powered conversational interface. Same data model, two user experiences.

**This is our key differentiator.**

### MongoDB-Native

Not another integration to maintain. Forms map directly to document schemas. Workflows query and update collections natively. No translation layer.

### True Ownership

Open source (MIT license). Export any app as a standalone Next.js project. No lock-in, real escape hatches.

Developers evaluate this first—we pass that test.

## Where We're At

This is a real product with substantial functionality:

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| API Endpoints | 165+ powering forms, workflows, data management, AI |
| Templates | 100+ across 14 categories (healthcare, finance, HR, support) |
| Form Field Types | 30+ with conditional logic, computed fields, multi-page |
| Workflow Editor | Visual builder on ReactFlow with 25+ node types |
| Conversational Forms | RAG support for knowledge-grounded AI collection |

**Current focus:** Preparing the `@netpad/templates` NPM package launch, improving cloud platform UX, and building out testing infrastructure.

---

## The Opportunity

NetPad is past the "proof of concept" stage—the architecture is solid, core features work, and there's a clear path to market.

**What's missing:** Collaborators who want to build something meaningful, not just ship tickets.

### Target Users

IT and platform teams at SMBs (50-500 employees), particularly in **Finance** and **Healthcare**. They need internal tools yesterday but don't have dedicated dev resources.

### Go-to-Market

Organic discovery for now. Developer-focused content, Hacker News, template library as a conversion tool. No paid campaigns yet.

---

## What Collaboration Looks Like

This isn't a job posting. We're looking for builders who want to:

- Ship real features that users will touch
- Have actual influence on product direction
- Work async with high autonomy
- Build something they're proud to show

### Three Tracks

| Track | Focus Areas |
|-------|-------------|
| **Product & Design** | UX flows, template curation, user research |
| **Full-Stack Engineering** | Features, infrastructure, DX improvements |
| **Integrations & Ecosystem** | MCP tools, third-party connectors, developer experience |

Time commitment is flexible. What matters is momentum, not hours logged.
