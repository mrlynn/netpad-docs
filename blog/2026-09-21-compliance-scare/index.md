## The Pain Is Real

Sirens wail. Red lights flash. "COMPLIANCE AUDIT INCOMING!" Papers fly everywhere as you scramble to document policies that exist only in theory, find evidence of controls that were never implemented, and explain security measures that are more aspiration than reality. Compliance isn't just paperwork—it's existential risk.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why This Happens

Compliance gets deferred because it's not urgent (until it is):

- **Building features** feels more valuable than documenting controls
- **Security measures** take time away from shipping
- **Audit preparation** is painful and boring
- **Requirements** are complex and technical

The debt accumulates until audit time. Then you discover:

- No encryption documentation
- No access logs
- No incident response plan
- No data retention policy

Failing an audit isn't just embarrassing—it can mean lost contracts, regulatory fines, or inability to do business with enterprise customers.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad builds compliance into the platform:

- **Encryption** - At rest and in transit, always on
- **Audit logs** - Every action tracked automatically
- **Access control** - Role-based permissions with logging
- **Data handling** - Clear retention and deletion options
- **Documentation** - Security architecture documented

You don't add compliance later—it's there from the start. When the auditor asks about encryption, you show the architecture. When they ask about access logs, you export them. The evidence exists because the features exist.

## Try It Yourself

Build compliant applications from day one. [Explore NetPad's security features](/docs/security/encryption) and be ready for your next audit before they announce it.
