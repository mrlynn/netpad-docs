![The Feature Request Pile](./comic.png)

## The Pain Is Real

The pile of sticky notes towers over you. "Can we add a field?" "Can we change the flow?" "Can we add validation?" "Can we make this optional?" Each request is reasonable. Each requires custom development. The backlog grows. Users wait. The answer to every simple request is "that's 6 months of custom development."

<!-- truncate -->

## Why This Happens

When forms are code, changes require coding:

- Add a field → developer time
- Change validation → developer time
- Modify flow → developer time
- Adjust labels → developer time (really)

Development time is expensive and scarce:

- Sprint planning required
- Code review required
- Testing required
- Deployment required

Simple requests compete with complex features. Users learn to stop asking because the answer is always "not this quarter."

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad makes most changes configuration, not code:

- **Add a field** → Drag and drop
- **Change validation** → Toggle a setting
- **Modify flow** → Adjust in visual builder
- **Adjust labels** → Edit text

Changes take minutes, not sprints. Users can often make changes themselves. Developer time focuses on genuinely complex requirements, not routine customization.

The boundary shifts: coding is for truly custom logic, not basic form configuration.

## Try It Yourself

Customize without sprints. [See NetPad's configuration options](/docs/forms/form-builder) and reclaim developer time for work that actually needs it.
