![The Copy-Paste Curse](./comic.webp)

## The Pain Is Real

"We need another contact form. Slightly different." So you copy the existing form. Then copy it again for the next variation. Then copy that copy. Six months later, you have 47 contact forms, each slightly different, each maintained separately, and when someone asks to update the privacy policy link across all of them... you weep.

## Why This Happens

Copying feels easy:

- No need to start from scratch
- Preserves working configuration
- Faster than rebuilding
- "I'll clean it up later"

But copying has hidden costs:

- **Maintenance multiplication** - Every copy is another thing to maintain
- **Drift** - Copies diverge as they're modified independently
- **Inconsistency** - Similar forms behave differently
- **Updates** - Changes must be made everywhere manually

The copy-paste habit creates form sprawl. Finding the "right" form becomes impossible. Users experience inconsistent interfaces. Updates become dreaded projects.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad provides alternatives to endless copying:

- **25+ built-in templates** - Start with proven patterns
- **Custom templates** - Create reusable starting points
- **Shared components** - Define once, use everywhere
- **Configuration options** - Variation through settings, not copies
- **Template inheritance** - Update parent, children follow

When you need a new contact form, start from a template. Configure the differences. The common elements remain linked. Update the template, all forms using it benefit.

## Try It Yourself

Break the copy-paste cycle. [Explore NetPad's template system](/docs/forms/form-builder) and manage variations without multiplication.
