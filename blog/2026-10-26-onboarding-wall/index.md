![The Onboarding Wall](./comic.webp)

## The Pain Is Real

New user logs in. A wall of features towers over them. Buttons everywhere. Menus nested in menus. Documentation assumes knowledge they don't have. Eyes wide with confusion, they ask the question every complex tool dreads: "Where do I even start?"

## Why This Happens

Powerful tools have many features. Many features require many controls. Many controls create overwhelming interfaces. The tension is real:

- **Expert users** need quick access to everything
- **New users** need guidance to get started
- **Documentation** assumes some baseline knowledge
- **UI design** tries to serve both (and serves neither perfectly)

The onboarding problem gets worse as products mature. Features accumulate. Each feature made sense when added, but the sum is overwhelming. New users face a learning cliff, not a learning curve.

First impressions matter. Users who fail to accomplish something quickly often never return.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad uses progressive disclosure:

- **Guided first steps** - Clear path to first success
- **Contextual help** - Explanations where you need them
- **Templates** - Start with working examples
- **Sensible defaults** - Good choices made for you
- **Feature revelation** - Advanced options appear as you need them

Your first form should be built in minutes. Understanding every feature can take weeks. The onboarding path respects this: get you productive quickly, reveal depth over time.

## Try It Yourself

Experience onboarding done right. [Start your first NetPad project](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) and see how quickly you can build something real.
