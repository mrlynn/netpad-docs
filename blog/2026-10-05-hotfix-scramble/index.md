![The Hotfix Scramble](./comic.png)

## The Pain Is Real

"PRODUCTION IS DOWN!" You have the fix ready—it's literally three lines. But between you and production: approval processes, code reviews, deployment queues, and change management procedures. All designed for normal changes. Nobody planned for emergencies. The building is burning while you wait for the fire extinguisher to be approved.

## Why This Happens

Organizations create process for good reasons:

- **Code review** catches bugs before production
- **Approval workflows** ensure proper authorization
- **Change management** maintains audit trails
- **Deployment queues** prevent conflicts

But standard processes assume standard timelines. Hotfixes need:

- **Speed** - Minutes matter
- **Focus** - Minimal review of minimal change
- **Access** - Right people, right permissions, right now
- **Documentation** - After, not before

When emergency procedures don't exist, teams either follow normal process (too slow) or bypass everything (too risky). Neither is good.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad supports rapid iteration when needed:

- **Instant changes** - Modify forms and workflows without deployment
- **Version history** - Track what changed, when, by whom
- **Quick rollback** - Undo changes instantly if they make things worse
- **Environment promotion** - Fast path from fix to production
- **Audit trail** - Document what happened, even in emergencies

Make the fix. It's live immediately. If it's wrong, roll back. Document afterward. The platform supports both careful process and emergency response.

## Try It Yourself

Fix issues at business speed. [Learn about NetPad's change management](/docs/platform/applications) and be ready when production needs immediate attention.
