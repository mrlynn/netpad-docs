![Agent Overload](./comic.png)

## The Pain Is Real

"Add validation!" shouts one AI agent. "Remove validation!" counters another. "Use a dropdown!" suggests a third. You're surrounded by AI assistants, each with strong opinions, none coordinating with the others. Instead of help, you have chaos—multiple AI voices talking over each other while you try to build a simple form.

## Why This Happens

AI agents are getting more capable, but they're still typically:

- **Single-purpose** - Each agent knows one domain well
- **Context-limited** - Can't see what other agents have done
- **Uncoordinated** - No awareness of parallel suggestions
- **Opinionated** - Trained to give confident answers

When you use multiple AI tools without orchestration, you become the coordinator. You translate between agents, resolve contradictions, and synthesize their outputs. The cognitive load defeats the purpose of having AI assistants.

The challenge is that different tasks genuinely benefit from different AI specializations. A form-building agent knows form patterns. A data analysis agent understands data structures. A content agent writes good copy. You need all of them, but you need them working together.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad provides 15+ specialized AI agents that work in harmony:

- **Form agents** - Understand form design and field types
- **Data agents** - Analyze and transform data
- **Workflow agents** - Design automation logic
- **Content agents** - Generate descriptions and labels
- **Query agents** - Help build complex searches

These agents share context through NetPad. When the form agent creates a structure, the data agent understands it. When you ask for improvements, each agent contributes its expertise without contradicting the others.
