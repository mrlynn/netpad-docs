## The Pain Is Real

"The weekly report is due in 5 minutes!" You're frantically copy-pasting data from the system into a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is crying (metaphorically—it's the same spreadsheet from Week 10). Every week, same ritual: export, paste, format, calculate, email. There must be a better way.

## Why This Happens

Reports live in spreadsheets because:

- **Flexibility** - Excel does whatever you need
- **Familiarity** - Everyone knows spreadsheets
- **Control** - Customize formatting exactly
- **History** - "We've always done it this way"

But spreadsheet reporting has costs:

- **Manual effort** - Hours of repetitive work weekly
- **Error prone** - Typos, wrong formulas, missed rows
- **Stale instantly** - Report is outdated as soon as you finish
- **Undocumented** - Only one person knows how to build it
- **Inconsistent** - Different people format differently

When reports depend on manual work, they're late, wrong, or both. The person who builds them becomes a bottleneck. When they're out, reports don't get built.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad includes built-in analytics that eliminate manual reporting:

- **Real-time dashboards** - Always current, no manual refresh
- **Configurable views** - Show the metrics that matter
- **Automated delivery** - Schedule reports to email
- **Consistent output** - Same format every time
- **Self-service** - Users can access data without asking

Your weekly report becomes a dashboard that updates itself. Stakeholders can check it anytime. Scheduled emails deliver snapshots when needed. No more Wednesday afternoon spreadsheet panic.

## Try It Yourself

Free yourself from spreadsheet reports. [Build dashboards in NetPad](/docs/data-explorer/browsing-data) and spend your time on work that matters.
