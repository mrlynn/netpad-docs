![Access Review Dread](./comic.webp)

## The Pain Is Real

The auditor's clipboard is ready. Their pen hovers ominously. "Show me who has access to what, and show me the documentation." You frantically search through admin panels, export user lists, and try to explain an access model that exists mostly in tribal knowledge. The audit clock is ticking.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why This Happens

Access reviews are required but unloved:

- **SOC 2** - Prove access is reviewed regularly
- **GDPR** - Know who can access personal data
- **HIPAA** - Document access to health information
- **PCI DSS** - Control access to cardholder data

But access documentation lags behind reality:

- Users added "temporarily" become permanent
- Roles accumulate as people change positions
- Offboarded users aren't fully removed
- Access requests approved informally

When the audit comes, you're reconstructing access history from memory and hoping your admin panels export something useful.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad makes access reviews straightforward:

- **Clear permission model** - Who has what access, visible at a glance
- **Access reports** - Export who can access which resources
- **Change history** - When access was granted or revoked
- **Role documentation** - What each role can do
- **Review workflow** - Scheduled access reviews with approval

When the auditor asks "who has access to customer data," you run a report. When they ask "when was this access granted," you show the log. When they ask "how often do you review access," you show the review schedule.

## Try It Yourself

Pass your next audit with confidence. [Learn about NetPad's access management](/docs/security/access-control) and have answers ready before anyone asks.
