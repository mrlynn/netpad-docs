![The Permission Request Email](./comic.webp)

## The Pain Is Real

"Can I get access to the project?" An email begins its journey. CC: IT. Reply: "Who's the owner?" Reply-all: "Check with Sarah." Forward to Sarah. Out of office. Escalate to manager. Form A-17 required. The email chain grows longer while the user waits for access to do their job.

## Why This Happens

Access requests become email threads because:

- **No central system** - No obvious place to request access
- **Unclear ownership** - Nobody knows who approves what
- **Manual process** - Humans in the loop at every step
- **Audit requirements** - Email creates a paper trail (sort of)

The friction compounds:

- Requester doesn't know who to ask
- Owner doesn't see request promptly
- Approvals require context gathering
- Provisioning requires manual steps

Each step adds delay. A simple access grant takes days. People find workarounds (sharing credentials, over-permissioning) because the official process is too slow.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad simplifies access granting:

- **Direct invites** - One click to add a user
- **Role selection** - Clear options for what access to grant
- **Instant provisioning** - Access active immediately
- **Audit logging** - Who granted what, when
- **Self-service requests** - Users can request access through the platform

Adding someone to a project: enter their email, select their role, click invite. They receive access immediately. The audit trail captures everything. No email chain required.

## Try It Yourself

Invite team members without the overhead. [Manage your team in NetPad](/docs/platform/organizations) and turn multi-day processes into seconds.
