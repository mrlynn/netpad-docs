![Metrics Mystery](./comic.webp)

## The Pain Is Real

The chart is labeled "???". Question marks float around it. You have data—lots of data—but what does it mean? Numbers without context are just noise. Your dashboard shows that something is 47, but is that good? Bad? Better than last week? You have data. You don't have insight.

## Why This Happens

Data collection is easier than data understanding:

- **Volume without structure** - Lots of records, no clear patterns
- **Metrics without context** - Numbers without benchmarks
- **Charts without labels** - Visuals that don't explain themselves
- **Data without questions** - Collecting before knowing what to ask

The gap between data and insight is analysis. Someone needs to:

- Ask the right questions
- Aggregate appropriately
- Compare against baselines
- Surface meaningful patterns
- Present findings clearly

Without that work, data sits unused. Decisions get made on intuition because the data is too hard to interpret.

## The NetPad Approach

NetPad helps transform data into understanding:

- **Aggregations** - Sum, average, count, group by
- **Time comparisons** - This week vs. last week, trend over time
- **Calculated fields** - Derive metrics from raw data
- **Visual clarity** - Charts that explain what you're seeing
- **Drill-down** - Click a metric to see underlying records

Start with a question: "How many submissions this month, compared to last month?" Build a view that answers it. The answer leads to more questions, and the data is there to answer those too.

## Try It Yourself

Turn your data into stories. [Create analytics views in NetPad](/docs/data-explorer/browsing-data) and finally understand what your numbers are telling you.
