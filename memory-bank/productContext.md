## Product Context — NetPad Documentation Site

### Why this project exists

The NetPad platform is a comprehensive MongoDB-native data management platform with extensive features including forms, workflows, AI-powered conversational interfaces, marketplace, and developer packages. Users and developers need clear, comprehensive documentation to effectively use and extend the platform. This documentation site provides that essential resource.

### Problems it solves

- **Documentation gaps:** Platform has extensive features but needs comprehensive documentation
- **Developer onboarding:** Developers need clear guides for using `@netpad/*` packages and MCP server
- **User guidance:** Users need step-by-step guides for all platform features
- **API discovery:** Developers need complete API reference for programmatic access
- **Deployment clarity:** Teams need clear deployment guides for all modes (cloud, self-hosted, standalone)
- **Knowledge sync:** Documentation must stay synchronized with rapidly evolving platform features

### How it should work

**For Documentation Users:**
1. Visit docs.netpad.io
2. Navigate to relevant section (Getting Started, Forms, Workflows, API, etc.)
3. Follow step-by-step guides with code examples
4. Reference API documentation for programmatic access
5. Use search functionality to find specific topics

**For Documentation Maintainers:**
1. Keep memory bank synchronized with application engineering project
2. Update documentation as platform features evolve
3. Use custom components for enhanced documentation experience
4. Follow established documentation structure and patterns
5. Deploy automatically via GitHub Actions on push to main

**Documentation Structure:**
- Clear navigation via sidebars.js
- Organized by feature area (Forms, Workflows, Platform, etc.)
- Developer-focused sections for packages and architecture
- API reference for all endpoints
- Deployment guides for all modes

### User experience goals
